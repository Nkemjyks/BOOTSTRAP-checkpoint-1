                <p>Clam dip is one of those old-timey New England dishes that is popular up and down the coast, often made for family gatherings like barbecues or holidays. Every New Englander who knows the dip probably has an opinion on whether it should be made with cream cheese or sour cream (or both), and which mix-ins should be added. This version is classic and simple, made from cream cheese, canned clams (which you can use straight from the can, no cooking necessary), scallions, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. Feel free to serve it with your favorite dippers, whether those are potato chips, sliced vegetables or even Fritos.</p>

                <strong>Braised Chicken Legs With Grapes and Fennel</strong>
                <p>There's nothing wrong with defaulting to chicken when you're trying to think of dinner party ideas. The key is to select a truly special chicken recipe, like this easy sweet-and-spicy braise, made with ribbons of fennel and juicy table grapes. You'll want to have a loaf of bread on the side for sopping up the sauce.</p>
